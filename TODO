- Allow objects to be replaced entirely in state and trigger the necessary updates updates
- Change the shadowroot way of working, use `data-shadowroot=...` instead of the browser `shadowrootmode=open`
- Allow slots to be fullfilled with children automatically through html
- Understand what happens when sometimes some components don't run their JS files (a pattern I see is that happens in components with similar names but multiple hyphens) 
- Meditate on the current ways to place children of components, just that.
- Place a dispatch function on the rendering params.
- Auto send the "mount" event?
